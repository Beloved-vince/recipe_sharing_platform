# Recipe Sharing Platform API

The Recipe Sharing Platform API provides developers with a fast and easy way to build scalable recipe sharing applications without having to write excess code. With our API, users can upload, get details, and search for recipes, among other features.

## Getting Started

To get started with our API, you will need to sign up for an account on our website and generate an API key. Once you have an API key, you can start making API requests to our endpoints.

## API Endpoints

Our API provides the following endpoints:

- `/recipes` - Returns a list of all recipes.
- `/recipes/{id}` - Returns details for a specific recipe.
- `/recipes/search` - Searches for recipes by keyword or ingredients.
- `/recipes/random` - Returns a random recipe.

Each endpoint supports both JSON and XML response formats.

## Authentication

Access to our API requires an API key, which should be included in the headers of each request. If you do not include a valid API key, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized error.
